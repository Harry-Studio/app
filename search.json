I’m committed to building applications where your personal information stays in your hands, not uploaded to corporate servers for advertising or profit. In an era of data exploitation, I believe it’s time for software to return to its essence: serving users, not surveilling them.\n\nPrivacy is not about having something to hide. It’s about having something to protect: your autonomy, your dignity, and your right to be yourself.\n\n\n🎯 What I DoI create tools that:\n\n✨ Prioritize user experience over feature bloat\n🔒 Keep your data local and secure\n🌱 Respect your time and attention\n🚀 Focus on simplicity and elegance\n\nEvery line of code I write is guided by one principle: technology should empower individuals, not exploit them.\n\n🏃‍♂️ Beyond the ScreenWhen I’m not coding, you’ll find me:\n\n🛹 Skateboarding through city streets\n🚴 Cycling on scenic routes\n🚶 Power walking to clear my mind\n\nThese activities remind me that the best solutions often come when we step away from the keyboard and reconnect with the physical world.\n\n🌍 My Values\nUser sovereignty: You should control your technology, not the other way around\nDigital minimalism: Less is more when it comes to features\nOpen communication: Transparency builds trust\nContinuous learning: Every project is an opportunity to grow\nSustainability: Building for the long term, not quick profits\n\n\n📬 Get in TouchI’m always excited to connect with fellow developers, designers, and users who share these values.\n\n📧 Email: haoleiq@gmail.com\n🌐 Website: harry-studio.github.io&#x2F;app\n\nWhether you have a question, feedback, or just want to chat about technology and user freedom, feel free to reach out!\n\n“The best technology is the technology you don’t notice — it simply works, respects you, and gets out of your way.”\n"},{"title":"分类","url":"/app/categories/index.html","content":""},{"title":"📬联系","url":"/app/contact/index.html","content":"\n☎️: 17685921009\n🌏: canmeng_497269343\n🌏: Qin10121122\n🐧: 497269343\n📫: haoleiq@gmail.com\n🔗: harry-studio.github.io&#x2F;outsource\n📍: 青岛\n\n👉沟通前,还请先将需求文档发至以上邮箱!否则可能无法及时回复,感谢支持🙇\n\n需求文档是什么?\n项目合作须知\n\n\n"},{"title":"标签","url":"/app/tags/index.html","content":""}]
